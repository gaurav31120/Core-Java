18 Class And Object Theory

#1
Java is Object- Oriented Programming:-
In the real world, everything is an object like a pen, mouse, glass, etc.
Every object has two things:
An object knows something ( It has some properties)
An object does something( It has a behaviour)
Every object has a property and behaviour. It can also have multiple properties as well as multiple behaviours.
To create an object, first, we need to create a class.
Class act as a blueprint that contains the designing of an object.

#2
JVM creates objects in Java.
JVM creates an object but it requires a blueprint(class).

Thus, you create a class file that class file gets compiled to create a byte code and that byte code goes to the JVM and then JVM creates an object.
